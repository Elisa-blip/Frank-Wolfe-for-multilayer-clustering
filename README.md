# Frank-Wolfe-for-multilayer-clustering

We did this project for an Optimization for Data Science class. In it, starting from the ideas from the paper "Learning the Right Layers: a Data-Driven Layer-Aggregation Strategy for Semi-Supervised Learning on Multilayer Graphs" (Venturini et al,2023),
we implemented from scratch in Python a Zeroth-Order Frank Wolfe algorithm for semi-supervised clustering in multilayer graphs, including an away-step variant, and performed similar tests to those in the paper, on the same datasets.
